<h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Dealing with node, npm packages, mongoDB, mongoose, and express.</br> 
I've made a back end social media Restfull API that utilizes CRUD methods. </br>
 Utilizes virtuals/getters subdocuments and .populate to show and not store data as an object inside of the parent object.</br> 
 Utilizing CRUD methods for User/Thoughts/Reactions/Friends </br> 
 I've also have made it possible to delete the thoughts in a deleted User by using as follows. </br> 
 Thoughts.deleteMany({_id: {$in:dbUserData.thoughts}}) </br>
 This essentially will delete all the thoughts associated with the user that is being deleted by the id.</p> </br>

## Usage

1: Make sure you have MongoDB installed on your machine (if you don't, follow the instructions on the MongoDB Website)</br>
2: Clone the repo </br>
3: Install dependencies with npm -i </br>
4: Run npm start to run the server and make the API live </br>
5: Use your browser or an app like Insomnia to test the REST API. </br>
